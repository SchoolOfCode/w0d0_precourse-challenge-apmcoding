  Review of Tribute page work
  
During this precourse task I was able to test out all my nearly learned skills, my initial idea for the tribute page was to talk about the Cats thats I had adopted over the years, however as I couldnt upload my own images without getting codepen.io Pro, I decided to just talk about Cat adoption as a general topic instead as this, or just pet rescue in general is a topic that I am passionate about.
  
I focused heavily on trying as many new things as possible rather than focusing on the content itself and enjoyed testing the things I had learned in a real project. I stumbled across a few problems during the making of the tribute page but was able to solve them all in the end and pass all the relevant Test's.
This project showed me I still have alot to learn about github as I struggled with uploading the project and will go back over the pre-course work to improve these skills.
