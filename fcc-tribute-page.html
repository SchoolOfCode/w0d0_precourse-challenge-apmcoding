      Millie is ready for adoption today!</figcaption>
    <p id="tribute-info"> This page is dedicated to all the kitties I've adopted over the years - Bella, Elmo, Lola and Lotus. </br> </br>
      We want to bring awareness to those without homes, who have lives of love to give. </br>
      Approximately 3.4 million cats are taken to shelter every year in the UK. In 2020, the RSCPA investigated over 57,000 complaints of cruelty recieving 1,218,364 phone calls. With over 1000 cat shelters nationwide and tens of thousands in care at one time, there's plenty of furs needing homes. During lockdown and the pandemic, we have seen a massive rise in people owning cats and pets in general, but so many people still continue to buy not realising how many cats needs adopting.</br> </p>
    <p id="tribute-list">
      There are so many reasons and benefits to adopting, these include;
    <ul>
      <li>87% of people that have adopted agree cats bring joy.</li>
      <li>62% agreeing they relieve stress and lonliness.</li>
      <li>Once they pass around 18 months old, only 60 percent of cats get adopted. I get why everyone wants a kitten, however they grow out of that stage so quickly and theres already so many adult cats that need loving homes.</li>
      <li>In one study, researchers followed 4,435 people for 13 years. People who had owned cats in the past were less likely to die from a heart attack during that time than people who had never owned cats.</li>
      <li>Based on a survey of more than 2,200 young Scots ages 11-15, kids who had a strong bond with their kitties had a higher quality of life.</li>
    </ul>

      Speaking from our own personal experience, there isnt anything more satisfying or rewarding than giving an animal in a shelter a loving home for the rest of their days, even if they are already coming to the end of their lives. So next time you or your friends and family are considering getting a new cat for the family, convince them to look into a rescue.
